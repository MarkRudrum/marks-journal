I've been meaning to start writing for a while now. Not for any grand reason — just to have a place where I can think out loud, share what I'm learning, and maybe connect with a few people along the way.

## Why a blog?

There's something about writing that forces you to slow down. When an idea is just floating around in your head, it can feel brilliant and fully formed. But the moment you try to put it into words, you realize how many gaps there are. That's not a bad thing — it's the whole point.

I want this space to be a mix of things: reflections on what I'm reading, small projects I'm working on, ideas I'm turning over, and whatever else feels worth sharing.

## What to expect

I'm not committing to a schedule (that's a recipe for guilt, not creativity). Instead, I'll write when something feels ripe enough to share. Some posts will be long and thoughtful, others might be quick observations.

I figure the same goes for starting a blog.

## A small technical note

This site is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). It's simple, fast, and lets me write posts in Markdown — which means I can focus on the writing instead of fiddling with a CMS.

Here's what a code block looks like, in case I ever share code:

```python
def hello():
    print("Thanks for reading!")

hello()
```

That's it for now. If you've made it this far, thanks for stopping by. More to come.
